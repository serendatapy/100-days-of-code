could push elements into an array, then transform array into a string.

Could add brackets at the end of everything { + variable + }

Questions

-I have to install npm every time I reboot the computer ?
-When I do npm install cz, I'm I supposed to do it in the instatags folder or in the pre-course folder?
-With instatags if I run gulp lint, instead of linting it makes the server run! Is that because it has a gulp file?

-Do the contributions to codeworks show up on github? Will they show up?
