# 100 Days Of Code -Log of Alejandro Rene Valdivia

### Day 0: June 23, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Made portfolio more responsive by using vh values in css, continued work on instagram clone.

**Thoughts: I've actually been coding almost everyday since September last year! However my main purpose to join the challenge is ti push myself to make it completely 100% of the days, and to contribute to the bigger community with my experience (or lack of) coding.

### Day 1: June 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished studying HTML forms on Codecademy, finished twitter clone prep work for bootcamp. Instead for the 100 day challenge I spent an hour trying to get a text to animate, in the end I just got a blinking cursor!

**Thoughts: I think today's epiphany for me was to discover that being a software developer might just be a big roller coaster ride, where I alternate between feeling like Matrix 3 Neo and Matrix 1 beginning of the film Neo forever and ever...yikes!

### Day 2: June 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I taught english all day and after 12 hours, coming home from work really wanted to crash on the sofa, but the challenge made me do the hour of code

**Thoughts: Got through my first challenge at hacker rank...really thought I wouldn't make it, it was nearly midnight after an hour of hacking at the code and getting errors on the console, everything suddenly worked!

### Day 3: June 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more lessons of Codecademy Web developer path (CSS) & Managed to finish the warm up problems at hacker rank.

**Thoughts: I enjoy solving the problems and it helps me to think about the problems also from a term of efficiency, as timing is also tested. I like the idea that employers might be able to look at it one day and see that I've gone through it (hopefully!)

### Day 4: June 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more lessons of Codecademy Web developer path (CSS) & started solving the arrays section in hackerrank. Learned hot to give hover over effect using css to buttons, added it to unplugged project. 

**Thoughts: Easy challenges take me about 30-40 minutes, I wonder how long the medium and hard challenges will take XD *fear*

### Day 5: June 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more lessons of Codecademy Web developer path (CSS & Javascript) build a few projects that covered gaps in my knowledge & solved another problem in the arrays section in hacker rank. Learned how to give hover over effect using css to buttons adding media queries to avoid hover sticking on touch devices, added it to unplugged project.

**Thoughts: I'm happy with today's progress. Again thanks to the coding challenge I'm avoiding spending all my time on tutorials, and doing more problem solving than I otherwise would! Next hacker rank problem is medium difficulty XD *fear*.  With current progress speed should be able to finish both hacker rank interview kit + codecademy web developer course before the bootcamp, as well of course, as the extra credits of codeworks. Fingers crossed!

### Day 7: June 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work through Codecademy web developer track, with focus on JavaScript fundamentals. Did a lot of problem solving and mini projects. Tempted to do the Challenge projects but also want to make quick progress to the parts that interest me more, such as advanced JavaScript, react, nodejs. After lunch I also spend some time polishing up my portfolio projects. After watching many a video about portfolio I'm now certain that the magic 8 ball is not going to cut the mustard! 

**Thoughts: I feel really gutted that because I spent so much time trying to solve  the medium difficulty problem on hack reactor, I didn't commit any time to any other of my courses :( on top of that I also watched a video today that talked about how spending time on these platforms as a junior dev, when the time can be spent learning to do actual things (and thus doing real problem solving and getting a job) is much more productive. I myself found that doing the tasks help me to practice JavaScript, however I can totally understand how the time spend on REAL projects would really get me closer to my goals. So from now on I'll try to spend more time building things. I know I have to sooner or later! 
On the brighter side, sending messages of encouragement on twitter is really great :)
