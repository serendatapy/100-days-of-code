# 100 Days Of Code -Log of Alejandro Rene Valdivia

### Day 0: June 23, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Made portfolio more responsive by using vh values in css, continued work on instagram clone.

**Thoughts: I've actually been coding almost everyday since September last year! However my main purpose to join the challenge is ti push myself to make it completely 100% of the days, and to contribute to the bigger community with my experience (or lack of) coding.
