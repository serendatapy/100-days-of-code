# 100 Days Of Code -Log of Alejandro Rene Valdivia

### Day 0: June 23, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Made portfolio more responsive by using vh values in css, continued work on instagram clone.

**Thoughts: I've actually been coding almost everyday since September last year! However my main purpose to join the challenge is ti push myself to make it completely 100% of the days, and to contribute to the bigger community with my experience (or lack of) coding.

### Day 1: June 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished studying HTML forms on Codecademy, finished twitter clone prep work for bootcamp. Instead for the 100 day challenge I spent an hour trying to get a text to animate, in the end I just got a blinking cursor!

**Thoughts: I think today's epiphany for me was to discover that being a software developer might just be a big roller coaster ride, where I alternate between feeling like Matrix 3 Neo and Matrix 1 beginning of the film Neo forever and ever...yikes!
