# 100 Days Of Code -Log of Alejandro Rene Valdivia

### Day 0: June 23, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Made portfolio more responsive by using vh values in css, continued work on instagram clone.

**Thoughts: I've actually been coding almost everyday since September last year! However my main purpose to join the challenge is ti push myself to make it completely 100% of the days, and to contribute to the bigger community with my experience (or lack of) coding.

### Day 1: June 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished studying HTML forms on Codecademy, finished twitter clone prep work for bootcamp. Instead for the 100 day challenge I spent an hour trying to get a text to animate, in the end I just got a blinking cursor!

**Thoughts: I think today's epiphany for me was to discover that being a software developer might just be a big roller coaster ride, where I alternate between feeling like Matrix 3 Neo and Matrix 1 beginning of the film Neo forever and ever...yikes!

### Day 2: June 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I taught english all day and after 12 hours, coming home from work really wanted to crash on the sofa, but the challenge made me do the hour of code

**Thoughts: Got through my first challenge at hacker rank...really thought I wouldn't make it, it was nearly midnight after an hour of hacking at the code and getting errors on the console, everything suddenly worked!

### Day 3: June 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more lessons of Codecademy Web developer path (CSS) & Managed to finish the warm up problems at hacker rank.

**Thoughts: I enjoy solving the problems and it helps me to think about the problems also from a term of efficiency, as timing is also tested. I like the idea that employers might be able to look at it one day and see that I've gone through it (hopefully!)

### Day 4: June 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more lessons of Codecademy Web developer path (CSS) & started solving the arrays section in hackerrank. Learned hot to give hover over effect using css to buttons, added it to unplugged project. 

**Thoughts: Easy challenges take me about 30-40 minutes, I wonder how long the medium and hard challenges will take XD *fear*

### Day 5: June 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more lessons of Codecademy Web developer path (CSS & Javascript) build a few projects that covered gaps in my knowledge & solved another problem in the arrays section in hacker rank. Learned how to give hover over effect using css to buttons adding media queries to avoid hover sticking on touch devices, added it to unplugged project.

**Thoughts: I'm happy with today's progress. Again thanks to the coding challenge I'm avoiding spending all my time on tutorials, and doing more problem solving than I otherwise would! Next hacker rank problem is medium difficulty XD *fear*.  With current progress speed should be able to finish both hacker rank interview kit + codecademy web developer course before the bootcamp, as well of course, as the extra credits of codeworks. Fingers crossed!

### Day 6: June 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent all day trying a medium difficulty problem on hacker rank but no bananas!

**Link to work:**[HackerRank Profile Progress Check](https://www.hackerrank.com/arvaldivia)

### Day 7: June 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work through Codecademy web developer track, with focus on JavaScript fundamentals. Did a lot of problem solving and mini projects. Tempted to do the Challenge projects but also want to make quick progress to the parts that interest me more, such as advanced JavaScript, react, nodejs. After lunch I also spend some time polishing up my portfolio projects. After watching many a video about portfolio I'm now certain that the magic 8 ball is not going to cut the mustard! 

**Thoughts: I feel really gutted that because I spent so much time trying to solve  the medium difficulty problem on hack reactor, I didn't commit any time to any other of my courses :( on top of that I also watched a video today that talked about how spending time on these platforms as a junior dev, when the time can be spent learning to do actual things (and thus doing real problem solving and getting a job) is much more productive. I myself found that doing the tasks help me to practice JavaScript, however I can totally understand how the time spend on REAL projects would really get me closer to my goals. So from now on I'll try to spend more time building things. I know I have to sooner or later! 
On the brighter side, sending messages of encouragement on twitter is really great :)

### Day 8: July 1st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday evening stared doing an advanced Css course, and even getting through the first lesson was SO informative. I immediately started applying concepts to my projects. This morning instead I did more JavaScript practice, on arrays specifically. 

**Thoughts: I'm coming to the realisation of how important it is to have my own projects. Having my own projects actually allows me to put all the courses I'm doing into context. At the moment I'm currently only working on the unplugged website and my portfolio website, but I imagine that if I didn't even had those, it would be very difficult to put all I'm learning into practice, or into context. This is happening in terms of JavaScript, as I'm not sure where to put all this JavaScript I'm learning, so that definitely needs to be my next project. I'm almost ready to jump out into the wild!

### Day 9: July 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: The CSS course is so cool! :D I'm learning so many little tricks, and finding it incredibly easy to apply to my existing projects, such as moving text and button animations. This morning I also continue with JavaScript practice, almost got to the part that interests me, intermediate/advanced JavaScript and back-end development!

**Thoughts: Today I'm going to speak to my career counsellor after...so many months I can't even remember! In any case the question I asked her initially has already been answered, I don't have to go one way or the other, with so much time available, I can undoubtedly do both, and thanks to coding challenge, I HAVE to do at least an hour a day of personal projects, however I should see if I can increase that...an hour a day is a lot in any case! But is it enough?! I'm not sure whether to tell her about me signing up to another bootcamp or not :/ but I would really like to get it out of my chest. I would also really like to get on with doing my wordpress portfolio, seems like it's a waste to leave it altogether after the time invested.

### Day 10: July 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent wayyy too much time working on object in javascript. I feel a lot more confident now. This evening I forced myself to work on my portfolio so that I could get in my hour of coding, after about 15 minutes couldn't get enough of it :)

**Thoughts: It was a bit hard to study today, not because I'm not interested, but because it was hard to concentrate. I think my brain is fuming! I want to continue forever to code, but my body is giving signs of collapse

### Day 11: July 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on all 4 projects in 1 morning and I feel more satisfied than when I work on just 1 :) even if in fact I did very little for each one. Worked on Portfolio, udemy css, codeworks coursework and now codecademy objects.

**Thoughts: It's definitely better for my well being to work on all the things I need to do rather than focus too much on one!

### Day 12: July 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today is Sunday but I had to do my coding challenge. I did some JavaScript challenges on code academy. Since they were not guided, they count as coding time! 

**Thoughts: My body definitely needs a break, as it is breaking! Feel tensions on several parts that need loosening. Well I'm not gonna touch the computer for the rest of the day! :)

### Day 13: July 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent most of the day on codecademy tutorials, regarding DOM

**Thoughts: I found that doing pomodoro technique is definitely useful! I can do so much in those short breaks, that I would otherwise put off and feel bad about at the end of the day, send a message, do some tidying, do some exercise, get a cuppa. It's great. Yesterday my old friend from hastings offered me to collaborate with him in a project. I'm still trying to get my head around it, but the point is that the tech stack uses 4 technologies that I'm not familiar with. At my best calculations I guessed I could pick up a good notion of everything in a week which is not bad but I'm not sure yet what the timeframe for this project is, or how much he expects from me. I'm throwing myself willingly in the deepend, because from what I've understood about the carreer, it comes with the job, so I might as well start now! All my energies now on getting the tech stack under the belt.

### Day 14: July 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent most of the day on codecademy tutorials, regarding DOM + Objects + Handlebars.js

**Thoughts: Unfortunately the intermediate javascript is gonna be tough to finish in the little time I was hoping to do it in. The fact of the matter is that if I want to learn, I have to do projects which give me practice, it's useless running through material without learning. Tonight I'm going to have a quick look at the project I'll be doing, get more javascript done, and from tomorrow I'll have to spit my studies so that I manage to do something everyday. React must begin tomorrow!

### Day 15: July 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent most of the day on codecademy tutorials, regarding javascript Modules.

**Thoughts: I begin to feel that I'm really getting a good grip on things which I thought were complicated, and at the same time I still have a lot to learn! I grossly underestimated the entry level javascript requirements to react and now I'm realizing that before I get there I might still need to spend another week on javascript :( in the end I'm afraid I might not be able to participare the project of my friend. Have nothing to do but to push on!

### Day 16: July 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about error handling, promises and async await... I really hit a wall with promises and async await(not finished yet)

**Thoughts: It's quite tough this intermediate JavaScript, but I'm really learning about things I knew nothing about! I wonder how much is sticking! I'm happy to hear my friend is in no rush to do the project, and that I can learn with a bit more time, which I really need. I'm pushing ahead with all my resources on the web developer course in code academy. On the positive aspect I quite enjoy mingling with the people on tweeter! :) There are people at all levels, from beginners to experts, so sometimes I feel a bit crap, other times I'm actually able to help someone further behind :)

### Day 17: July 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to learned about error handling, promises and async await... I think I got it!

**Thoughts: For the last 2 days I just felt I kept hitting my head against a wall, doubting whether I'd ever be able to become a developer, it makes me laugh now after I think I've understood anything how I could think such a thing!

### Day 18: July 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to learned HTTP requests using XHR objects! Didn't imagine this chapter would be difficult, but manageable. 

**Thoughts: I'm very excited that I'm starting to use APIs in codeacademy, and so understanding how it all links together, can't way to go on!

**Link to work:** [Github Profile](https://github.com/serendatapy) [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/serendatapy)

### Day 19: July 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued learning about HTTP requests using fetch ()! gutted to find out fetch substitutes XHR :D at least the steps are more less the same. 

**Thoughts: Getting through HTTP requests not nearly fast enough, can't wait for react!

**Link to work:** [Github Profile](https://github.com/serendatapy) [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/serendatapy)

### Day 20: July 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished HTTP requests. Now I'm finally ready to start looking at react :D 

**Thoughts: Never imagined HTTP requests would take so long, but it has been such an important lesson. Definitely need to spend more time on it, as I managed to connect code to API and look through API documentation, it was all very exciting to have lots of information from external databases readily available in such a way. Amazing indeed! And I know I've just touched the surface, and haven't quite got my head around them yet, but truly very interesting :D also understood that making good APIs is a definite way of making money online. You need to have the idea though!

### Day 21: July 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Studied transpilation and cross browser compatability

**Thoughts: This was probably the last thing I thought I would learn about :D super interesting!

**Link to work:** [Github Profile](https://github.com/serendatapy) [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/serendatapy)

### Day 22: July 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started to learn about REACT... it's taking ages XD but as everyone says, if it was easy, everyone would do it!

**Thoughts: I just realised now that I forgot to log my progress yesterday... but I did code! It's just not gonna show up in GIT. I'm learning so much at the moment, I really hope that by the time I get to the bootcamp, they will really take me to 100%. In any case being over-prepared certainly can't be a disadvantage.

### Day 23: July 16th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning about react, functional components, class components, states and hooks. It's a lot of stuff!

**Thoughts: The course by Kyle is really Jammed packed with info, such that even a 10 minute video takes me about 30-40 minutes to complete due to having to pause and go back! I hope when I come out the other side I can actually use react, because at the moment I'm understading concepts and coding along, but not doing a lot of thinking by myself. I just realised I lost my codecademy streak. Was too imersed in doing react completly forgot about practicing. Going to do that now!

### Day 24: July 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went back to finish a DOM project on codeacademy. I'm really glad I did because I was beginning to forget vanilla javascript. 

**Thoughts: I think I'm going to have to continue learning java as I learn react to help my brain remember what I've done and distinguish clearly between react and javascript. I can't imagine I was thinking of Learning React and Typescript all in one week!

**Link to work:** [Github Profile](https://github.com/serendatapy) [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/serendatapy)



### Day 25: July 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued my practice with DOM on codecademy. 

**Thoughts: It's a particular day today. I used a lot of my study time to try to create a CV but didn't manage (old systems didn't work) I'm going to have to create a new one from scratch! Also today I'll be seeing my colleagues for what should be a kind of goodbye party...I'm a little anxious and sad, and excited all at the same time!

### Day 26: July 19th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I didn't manage to spend much time with coding, but managed to allow myself to enjoy my family. Did practice on older topics on codecademy today.  

**Thoughts: I was happy to allow myself to enjoy my family today, don't get much chance to nowadays

**Link to work:** [Github Profile](https://github.com/serendatapy) [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/serendatapy)

### Day 27: July 20th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on the javascript DOM project. I'm quite happy I'm managing to find my own solutions to a lot of the things that need to get done without the guidance. I also tried to get back into React, did a quick deployment in netlify.  

**Thoughts: I didn't do as much progress I usually do, only about 2/3 hours today. It was partly due to the fact that yesterday's drinking made my brain really fuzzy, and I couldn't concentrate on deep details. It was really strange to see my brain limited so much by drinking, I'll certainly be more careful in the future. I also spent a lot of the time writing a goodbye letter to my school! Way too long! I hope it has a good result at least. :)

### Day 28: July 21st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on the react course, slowly I'm understanding things but still don't feel at all ready to implement a react app on my own yet. 



**Thoughts: I got more stuff done today, getting back on track :) I really like react, it seems easy enough! I still don't understand much though, and haven't had any Ah Ha moments yet! 

**Link to work:** [Github Profile](https://github.com/serendatapy) [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/serendatapy)

### Day 29: July 22th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on the react course, slowly I'm understanding things but still don't feel at all ready to implement a react app on my own yet. Everything is actually the same as yesterday in this respect! Yesterday evening I also started Aaron's Algorithm course. 



**Thoughts: I'm quite happy about my progress, but I still feel far from understanding react in a production level. For sure I think I will do the Codecademy react course as a follow up to drill down the concepts in a more practical way, as at the moment I'm coding along a lot. For today I'm done with react in any case, I'm not sure what I'll work on this afternoon or evening, however I want to write my log now when possible, to avoid forgetting to do it!

### Day 30: July 22th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday evening I started working on the first Algorithm, find the first unique character. I think I did come up with some resource intensive nested loop solution, though I was really happy to learn that objects can be used as hashmaps, and that can be a much faster way of accessing information!  



**Thoughts: I'm excited to carry on with the algorithms course, and learning about data structures. This morning I couldn't resist and I bought another course on udemy. OMG when will I have time to complete all these courses I have pending! I got a course on machine learning with javascript, it looks amazing! Now I have a quizzilion things to do though

* Advanced Css course
* javascript the weird parts
* machine learning with javascript
* codeacademy web developer
* typescript course
* react course (3/4 done with this one)
* Algorithms and Datastructures course + hackreactor + leetcode!!

That's really plenty enough for the month and a half I've got left before starting the bootcamp. Who knows how far I'll get!

### Day 31: July 23th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I practiced everything a little and spent time updating my CV, it's really the most difficult thing! I studied React, Codeacademy DOM and Algorithms. 



**Thoughts: I'm quite enjoying the Algorithms course because I'm learning how to organize data and solve problems, and think about time and space complexity. 

**Link to work:** [Github Profile](https://github.com/serendatapy) [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/serendatapy)

### Day 32: July 24th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I haven't done anything yet, though I hope I will be able to do some revision on codeacademy at least.



**Thoughts: I think it's probably better I start reporting what I did the day before, the morning after, because sometimes I can forget to report! At least if I do it first thing in the morning it should work out well.

### Day 33: July 25th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I took a break in general, did a little practice on code academy.



**Thoughts: I think I've lost a day's log somewhere :/

**Link to work:** [Github Profile](https://github.com/serendatapy) [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/serendatapy)



### Day 34: July 26th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finshed the javascript DOM project and continued work on react. Hopefully I'll get a chance to do some algorithm this evening



**Thoughts: I have a headache, perhaps a cold, not able to concentrate so well but pushing on!

### Day 34: July 27th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I have a fever from yesterday, only managed to do a few codecademy exercises. I don't know if I'll have the strength to do much else. 



**Thoughts: I'm quite knocked out, I'm not counting this as another day of code, but I did want to show up!

**Link to work:** [Github Profile](https://github.com/serendatapy) [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/serendatapy)

### Day 35: July 28th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I hope to be able to finish my react course.



**Thoughts:  I feel stronger now and ready to learn, but at the same time feel quite demoralised and wonder if I'll ever be able to become a software developer. It still seems like such a long way to go! This react thing is really beating down on my morale! :) it's dragging on a bit. 

**Link to work:** [Github Profile](https://github.com/serendatapy) [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/serendatapy)



### Day 36: July 29th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I managed to finish the react course and do some on codeacademy



**Thoughts:  Though I don't fully understand react yet I understand how my self esteem at the moment is connected to how much I manage to study each day. Yikes. I can also see however that If I keep up the pace I will inevitably learn a lot in the 5 months I got left before starting the job search!

### Day 37: July 30th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I'm continuing on react today, and I will also do some CSS

**Thoughts:  Doing the second more in depth course on react is helping me a lot put the pieces together and understand really what was going on, but I have to do it together with my react crash course, that though lighter, was actually more focused on modern react only. This way I'll come out with a good grasp hopefully of both reach with classes and react with hooks! I do feel it a bit useless learning react with classes, as I now know hooks are so much better, but my objective should be breath of knowledge rather than optimal I believe.

### Day 38: July 31st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent all day trying to get another VM working. Disaster for study. Did a little revision on react and codecademy, and had a revision of css components.

**Thoughts:  I need to learn to stop spending excessive amounts of time on things that will bring about marginal benefits!

### Day 38: August 1st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Only a little revision on codecademy, and a little react. Not enough to justify a day of  coding though. 

**Thoughts: This week in general I haven't been very productive, both because of being ill at the beginning of the week has left me with a strange mental fog, with I think is finishing now, and also because it was my last week of work. I wondered today if there is still an identity crisis to come.... :) naah!

### Day 39: August 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went through the react course again and annotated the project I did to help me fully understand how the program works. 

**Thoughts: I'm very tempted to move onto something else but I will try the extension suggestions Kyle gave. I have to think about how I can change the topic so instead of a recipe list it could be the list of something more useful/interesting to me. What is similar to a recipe book? I still wonder whether I'll ever learn react :D but little by little I am making progress.

### Day 40: August 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent the day on React and extra credit. Also spent time setting up linux 20, wondering if it could have a better performance on my machine. Looks good, though not looking forward to setting up the environment again!

**Thoughts:  I'm beginning to feel a little more confident with it. I can see also my confidence is directly proportional to the risks I take to figure out things on my own.  Also my understanding get immediately cemented. Can't wait to start the Netflix Clone project, looks really cool, and not too difficult considering it's all repeating components.

### Day 41: August 4th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent the day on React building the Netflix clone. 

**Thoughts:  Really shocked at how simple a netflix app could be. Sure it's just the front-end, and the API calls are really not very easy to understand at all (poorly documented) but I'm really excited about it! It's about half way there and it's already looking really good. I also started filling in a few things myself when I knew what it could be. I think if I did a few more projects like that things would become even more evident. The video was 3 hours long, but it took me all day! Learned about chaining with ? which looks quite cool. Also used a little bit of emmet. Really need to start spending time on these speed tricks. I'm not sure if I'll get a chance to get through all the codecademy curriculum at this speed however.

### Day 42: August 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished React Clone and First part of Codecademy React Project

**Thoughts:  I'm a bit lost as to how to proceed now. I really want to move on in the Codecademy work. However I also feel that if I don't polish up the Netflix Clone and make it my own, it will be something I won't be able to put in my project. Instead I really should, and take it to an authentication level. I really want to get started with the Javascript AI course, and I know I really should be doing the javascript the weird parts course and Css and Sass course. OMG, Tecnical KO.

### Day 43: August 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up Netflix react code, added some fixes to make the experience better. Still work to do. 

**Thoughts:  I have to admit that as soon as I start going out of the rails I'm very tempted to go back, however I would really like to have the netflix clone in my portfolio, which means polishing the product until it's more than portfolio ready.

### Day 44: August 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I had a good look at the machine learning course. There is a lot of functions to clean up data and some math, not overly complicated, to calculate some things. I haven't quite seen 'learning' take place yet, more like the application of algorithms. Certainly could be a more interesting application than toy problems!

**Thoughts:  Today I'm quite exhausted, I watched the machine learning tutorial but I was really tired, so I'm not sure if I found it quite boring or if I was really exhaused (likely as I've been up since 3 o'clock this morning.)

### Day 45: August 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued Work ok React Classes

**Thoughts:  I have doubts whether continuing work on React classes is actually helpful or not. On some aspects it's helping me understand more about the basics of react. On the other hand, hooks just seems to work a lot better without a lot of the complications. Can't imagine using react Classes. However I'm sure I could NEED to update old react code, and in that case a knowledge in it could make me a better react developer overall.

### Day 46: August 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued Work ok React Classes on Codecademy and polishing Netflix Clone. 

**Thoughts:  I don't really have difficulties on Codecademy, however today I made no progress on the Netflix clone enhancement. I spent, perhaps 4 hours trying to figure out how to get the movies to scroll on desktop, trying different packages. I'm afraid the solution will be a long one in the end. The best solution, I can already see, will be the one to implement arrows, which is how it's implemented on the original site, probably to avoid accidental clicking of movies. When I spend so much time though I do wonder if it's worth fixing at all!

### Day 47: August 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made progress just in codecademy today. 

**Thoughts:  I think I'm coming to grips with something, but at the same time I still get quite lost when the components become many. Classes in react are quite complex with the fact they need to bind and use this, so much more than with hooks and usestates which simplified the situation tremendously. I'm pushing through, but I always wonder if it's worthwhile considering I'm probably just going to use modern React. It's hard to allow myself to accept that to know something well you need to know all the ins and outs.

### Day 48: August 11th, 2020 - 40 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**: Continued studying React. 

**Thoughts: Really it's quite a big topic! I can't imagine how I thought to learn everything so quickly, I must've been mad. Hope Leo doesn't have a problem with the fact that I wasn't able to start on his project at all. After learning react I would still need to learn typescript and the ui.js of microsoft, it's really a lot! At the moment I'd rather finish the codecademy course that will at least give me an overview of full stack development, including server stuff, before deep diving into it in the bootcamp. Looking at the bootcamp's programme, it seems unlikely that I would've learned react in 3 days! And angular in 3 days!? how would that even be possible, I must absolutely brush up on it. It's true that if I used just modern react, everything is much simpler, and at the moment I feel I'm going quite into depth of react with codecademy. Oh...I hope I'm going the right way, I often wonder!

### Day 49: August 12th, 2020 - 39 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**: Continued studying React.

**Thoughts: I've reached the final project of React. Can't wait to finish and start on Node.js and backend work. At the moment I'm quite confident I might be able to finish everything before the bootcamp if I manage to maintain this speed...I hope! I'm gonna do something else now to get away from react. I think the final project is gonna be a long one, but looks exciting! It's doing spotify, so I guess if I make also the spotify clone afterwards it might actually give me a good all round understanding of react with and without hooks.

### Day 50: August 13th, 2020 - 38 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**:  Did another problem on leetcode using pointers

**Thoughts:  I quite enjoy doing 'toy' problems when I'm too tired to study they're quite interesting.

### Day 51: August 14th, 2020 - 37 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**:  Node.js Intro

**Thoughts:  with driving my mum around england I'm quite struggling to keep up with the 100 days of code. I'm going to take a break, but I think I'm at least going to start doing something!

### Day 52: August 16th, 2020 - 35 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**:  Started node.js & lodash library re-writing. Finished algorithms from yesterday

**Thoughts: I always question if what I'm doing is the best I can do in this moment. Perhaps I need a mentor? I like coding however :)

### Day 53: August 17th, 2020 - 34 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**:  Revisiting Underline Codeworks coursework

**Thoughts: Looking through the code again is interesting, it makes me see that I've learned because I'm
able to refactor it, to make it more efficient/readable. I met quite a few 'classmates' of the cohort today, things are looking good!

### Day 54: August 18th, 2020 - 33 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**:  Revisiting Underline Codeworks coursework

**Thoughts: Studying without a regular routine and on holiday is really exhausting. Was so tempted to just go to bed but gather up the courage to sit here for at least an hour looking at code.

### Day 55: August 19th, 2020 - 32 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**:  Revisiting Underline Codeworks coursework

**Thoughts: I had the super session today, and spoke to some classmates. Since they're all working on underline I decided to dedicate my time to cleaning up and refactoring my underline code, it appears there was quite a bit of polishing to do! It's motivating also because I should be doing some code comparing soon, and I want to be prepared for that. I hope I manage to remember everything I left off in Codecademy.

### Day 56: August 20th, 2020 - 31 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**:  Revisiting Underline Codeworks coursework

**Thoughts: It's amazing how much I'm learning through refactoring code, explaining what I've done(to classmates) and applying new methods, I'm glad I had so much time to do the pre-course so that I'm able to really savour it now.

### Day 57: August 21th, 2020 - 30 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**:  Did Javascript the Weird Parts Course

**Thoughts: Today I flew back to Italy from England, though it was a long journey, I was really chuffed that I managed to do more than half of Javascript the weird parts course. Fascinating!

### Day 58: August 22th, 2020 - 29 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**:  Revisiting Underline Codeworks coursework

**Thoughts: It's quite satisfying learning a new trick, and seeing that it can be applied everywhere to make code simpler!

### Day 59: August 23th, 2020 - 28 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**:  Revisiting Underline Codeworks coursework

**Thoughts: When my students asked me if doing something is helpful, I remember giving them a little direction, but ultimately telling them that anything they do will always be helpful, because it's another contact they have with the language, and any contact adds. I hope I was right. I'm spending a lot of time polishing underline, and I feel I'm grasping a lot of new things, and gaining an ever deeper understanding of what I've done. But since I'm not coding a lot, just adding and removing bits of code, I wonder if I'm spending my time in the most productive way.

### Day 60: August 24th, 2020 - 27 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**:  Revisited stringify and instatags Codeworks coursework

**Thoughts: It's amazing how much extra work I could do on top of the completed coursework, in terms of refactoring and doing extra credit tasks, still not sure how much longer it will take to finish that part, but I begin to see the end of the tunnel, so at this point I think I will go back to working on react and node.

### Day 61: August 25th, 2020 - 26 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**:  Revisited underline and worked on Lodash library

**Thoughts: I have to believe that taking care of the little road I see ahead of me WILL take me to where I want to go...Perhaps I should spend a little
more time thinking about where I want to go :)

### Day 62: August 26th, 2020 - 25 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**:  Did a bit more Javascript the weird parts, super session, finished lodash library 

**Thoughts: Spent a lot of time trying to install ubuntu on my PC, dualboot is not as simple as it used to be. I still haven't managed to get it to work. I hope all my efforts are not wasted. I think working on the pc will be advantageous to working on the laptop, it will also give me a chance to practice the pull push flow a bit more. Certainly having 2 PCs/screens is better than one :)

### Day 62: August 27th, 2020 - 24 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**:  I didn't manage to do much at all, apart from intall linux on my PC on dual boot. In the end I managed :) bloody nvidia graphics cards drive me crazy!

**Thoughts: Can't count today as a coding day, hope I manage a bit more tomorrow!

### Day 63: August 28th, 2020 - 23 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**: Done some study on Node.js, hopefully later I'll get a chance to look at react again and algorithms which I've kinda abandoned for a while. 

**Thoughts: I really didn't understand much at all about node.js, hope I get a bit more practice on it

### Day 63: August 29th, 2020 - 22 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**: Didn't manage to do anything except a light revision, my sister is here!

**Thoughts: I've had a lot of trouble studying lately with all that's been going on in my life. Today after 36 years I've met my sister for the first time!!

### Day 64: August 30th, 2020 - 21 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**: Studying REST. 

**Thoughts: Today my sister has left late in the afternoon, it's been nice having her around, but it is an awful period as I can't take much time off, I need to study as much as I can. Though I have 21 days left, I believe they're gonna be more like 15 for all the things I have to do. I hope I do manage to finish all the things I want to do in this time!

### Day 65: August 31th, 2020 - 20 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**: Studied Rest + express, algorithms, weird javascript, Regex

**Thoughts: I like doing a lot of little things rather than big things and forget a lot! At the same time I like finishing things quickly...dilema! I hope I can keep up with this rhythm and get everything done!

### Day 66: September 1st, 2020 - 19 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**: Vs code trick and CSS, algorithms, weird javascript, Regex

**Thoughts: Reasonably productive :) I have to optimize my diet I think, and definitely remove distractions! Had a lot of messages today from sister, ex boss, classmates, and had to help everyone in one way or another!

### Day 69: September 4th, 2020 - 16 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**: everything!

**Thoughts: Today I managed to use pomodoro tecnique and do a little progress on all aspects I want to work on. The question as to what I should be focusing on remains. I'm very tempted to deepdive into CSS and HTML for looks, but at the same time I really have no idea about servers or testing, as well as needing some brush up on react and to discover Angular, so perhaps in this case it might be better to have breath rather than depth, so as to have some concept of everything before begining my bootcamp. In the end everyone enjoyed the questions I posted! I didn't expect it, it was all quiet for days and suddenly everyone sprang up! Critical mass and perseverance!

### Day 70: September 5th, 2020 - 15 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**: Regex, weird javascript, express, algorithms

**Thoughts: I'm taking half a day off perhaps! Not sure how good it is for me to work on these things everyday! Maybe I'm going crazy XD I do love it, kinda addicted to it actually. I really feel how important taking short breaks is, my body thanks me for it.

### Day 72: September 7th, 2020 - 13 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**: Regex, express, weird javascript

### Day 73: September 8th, 2020 - 12 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**: Regex, express, weird javascript

**Thoughts: It's been a slow day with work, I need to use pomodoro also to avoid having breaks that extend too long! xD Pushing on with express, I hope it will all be worth it in the end. Very tempted to carry on working with React technologies though, I think I will include it in my study list now that I've finished weird javascript. Or shall I do AI?

### Day 74: September 9th, 2020 - 11 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**: Regex, express, React+Gatsby

**Thoughts: I managed to take breaks and control their length, so I got a lot of little things done today. I hope I'll still be able to do more studying, but tomorrow I have to do exams so I want to practice that so I don't flop! I started doing some work on React again. I'm happy about that because I think it does look like a fun tool to make websites!

**Today's Progress**: Regex

**Thoughts: Today I spent my time trying to optimize my computer in the best possible way to enable me to work as well as possible during the bootcamp. It took a while because I wasn't sure what the best option was. In the end I'm going to try a dual monitor setup, with laptop upgrades and hope for the best! This day doesn't count as a coding day.

### Day 76: September 12th, 2020 - 8 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**: Regex, express

**Thoughts: Today I spent most of my time trying to come up with some ideas about projects I could do with some classmates that were interested in making one! Tomorrow we're meeting for that. One thing we have agreed upon was in making the to do list with pomodoro timer. In the end it is among the 5 recommened projects for beginners, so let's do it!
-Calculator
-to do
-pomodoro
-wYSIWYG editor
-Calendar, Weather and time widget

-https://medium.com/free-code-camp/a-coding-project-a-day-for-20-days-5cd4c9383f84

I'm dreading the part where we'll talk about the technology stack to use, though I would suggest using things we're supposed to be learning, or are supposed to have learnt.

### Day 76: September 13th, 2020 - 7 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**: Regex + Project Planning

**Thoughts: Today the meeting was quite pleasant, and I think we got quite a nice team together. I need to take a break because I've had a stiff neck again for a few days, but today that I hardly did any programming it got much better. I'd like to rest again and tomorrow I'll get back on the saddle. Also we'll be starting the react project! Didn't do much coding though, so I won't count it.

### Day 77: September 14th, 2020 - 6 Days to Bootcamp

**Today's Progress**: Git + Project planning

**Thoughts: Today I spent the afternoon revising react and working through git problems with my classmates, it was fun, though I have no more energy to work on anything else at this time. I hope I'll be more productive tomorrow, I'm afraid I'm leaving my serious studying too much. On the other hand, this is also important isn't it?
